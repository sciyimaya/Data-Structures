<b>PERFORMANCE SCHEDULING LINKED LIST</b>

Planning a music festival is a lot of work and requires a great deal of coordination and organization. 
Often, a planned schedule needs to be changed over time to accommodate for unforeseen situations. Music performers need to be added or removed from the schedule in response to changing factors. Performance Scheduling Linked List implements an interface that will store all of the performances in the form of a LinkedList. LinkedList is efficient in these types of situations because the list can be modified without changing the whole structure of the existing list.
